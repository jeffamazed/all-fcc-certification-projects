# Polygon Area Calculator

This project is a **Polygon Area Calculator** built with **Python**.  
It allows you to create **Rectangle** and **Square** objects, calculate their areas, perimeters, diagonals, generate a visual representation with asterisks, and determine how many times one shape can fit inside another.

## Features

- Create **Rectangle** and **Square** objects
- Set or update width, height, or side length
- Calculate **area**, **perimeter**, and **diagonal**
- Generate a visual representation of the shape with `*` characters
- Determine how many times one shape fits inside another

## Tech Stack

- Python 3
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- String manipulation and arithmetic for shape rendering
