# Probability Calculator

This project is a **Probability Calculator** built with **Python**.  
It allows you to create a **Hat** object containing balls of different colors, simulate random draws, and calculate the probability of drawing a specific combination of balls over multiple experiments.

## Features

- Create a **Hat** object with any number of colored balls
- Draw a specified number of balls randomly from the hat
- Perform **probabilistic experiments** to estimate outcomes
- Count occurrences of specific combinations in draws
- Calculate the **probability of success** over many trials

## Tech Stack

- Python 3
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Randomization and probability simulation
- Dictionary and list manipulation
