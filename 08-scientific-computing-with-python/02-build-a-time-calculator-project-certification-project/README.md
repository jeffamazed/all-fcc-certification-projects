# Time Calculator

This project is a **Time Calculator** built with **Python**.  
It takes a start time, a duration to add, and an optional starting day of the week, then calculates the new time. The result is formatted in **12-hour clock format** with AM/PM, and can include the correct day of the week and how many days later the result falls.

## Features

- Add a duration (hours and minutes) to a given start time
- Handle 12-hour clock format with AM/PM conversion
- Correctly roll over to the next day or multiple days later
- Optionally calculate the resulting day of the week
- Format results with `(next day)` or `(<n> days later)` when appropriate

## Tech Stack

- Python 3
- String parsing and arithmetic with modular math
