Albert Einstein's Life Timeline:

- 1879: Born on March 14 in Ulm, Germany.
- 1889: At the age of 10, Einstein began to show an interest in mathematics and science.
- 1894: The Einstein family moved to Milan, Italy, after his father’s business failed. Albert continued his education in Switzerland.
- 1896: Graduated from the Swiss Federal Polytechnic in Zurich with a degree in physics and mathematics.
- 1901: Published his first scientific paper, "The Investigation of the State of Aether in Magnetic Fields."
- 1905: Published four groundbreaking papers, known as the *Annus Mirabilis* (Miracle Year) papers:
   - Special Theory of Relativity: Introduced the equation E = mc^2.
   - Photoelectric Effect: Explained the phenomenon of the photoelectric effect, which later earned him the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921.
   - Brownian Motion: Provided evidence for the atomic theory.
   - Mass–Energy Equivalence: Showed that mass can be converted into energy.
- 1911: Became a professor at the German University in Prague and later moved to the University of Zurich.
- 1915: Developed the General Theory of Relativity, fundamentally changing our understanding of gravity.
- 1919: His general theory of relativity was confirmed during a solar eclipse, making him an international celebrity.
- 1921: Awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for his explanation of the photoelectric effect, not for his theory of relativity.
- 1922: Traveled to Japan, China, and other countries on a lecture tour.
- 1933: Left Germany due to the rise of Adolf Hitler and the Nazi regime. Moved to the United States.
- 1939: Signed a letter to U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt, warning about the potential development of nuclear weapons by Nazi Germany. This led to the creation of the Manhattan Project.
