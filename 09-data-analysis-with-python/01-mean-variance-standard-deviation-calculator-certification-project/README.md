# Mean-Variance-Standard Deviation Calculator

This project is a **Mean-Variance-Standard Deviation Calculator** built with **Python**.  
It takes a list of nine numbers, reshapes them into a 3×3 matrix, and calculates the **mean**, **variance**, **standard deviation**, **maximum**, **minimum**, and **sum** for each row, column, and the entire matrix.

## Features

- Accepts a list of **nine numbers** as input  
- Converts the list into a **3×3 matrix**  
- Calculates key statistical measures:
  - Mean
  - Variance
  - Standard deviation
  - Maximum
  - Minimum
  - Sum
- Returns results for:
  - Each **row**
  - Each **column**
  - The **entire matrix**

## Tech Stack

- Python 3  
- NumPy for numerical computation
