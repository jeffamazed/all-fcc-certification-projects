1. Basic Structure of an HTML Document
This section should cover the core structure of an HTML document, such as the <!DOCTYPE html>, <html>, <head>, and <body> tags.
You can also explain how to create a simple "Hello, World!" page and highlight key elements that define a webpage's structure.

This section introduces the basic building blocks of web content.
3. Attributes

The core structure of an HTML document consists of several key elements that define the content and structure of a webpage. At the top, we have the <!DOCTYPE html> declaration, which defines the document type as HTML5. The root element is <html>, which contains the entire document and is typically assigned a lang attribute to specify the language of the content. Inside the <html> element, the <head> section contains metadata, links to stylesheets, and scripts, including the <meta> tags for character encoding and viewport settings. The <body> section holds the visible content of the page, such as headings, paragraphs, images, links, and other elements that users interact with. This basic structure provides the foundation for any webpage, and additional sections can be added depending on the needs of the content, like navigation, forms, and multimedia.
